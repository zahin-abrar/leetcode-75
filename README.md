# 📘 LeetCode 75 – Learning Through Problem Solving (Python)

This repository documents my journey through **LeetCode 75**, with a strong focus on **learning how to think**, not just writing correct code.

Each problem is solved using a **guided, step-by-step coaching approach with AI**, where the emphasis is on:
- reasoning,
- identifying patterns,
- understanding mistakes,
- and building reusable mental models.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This is **not** a collection of copy-pasted LeetCode solutions.

The goals are to:
- Develop strong problem-solving fundamentals
- Practice explaining *why* a solution works
- Build revision-ready learning artifacts
- Demonstrate **responsible and transparent AI-assisted learning**

Each problem includes a detailed Markdown guide that captures the **entire thought process**, from first intuition to final accepted solution.

## 🧠 How Problems Are Solved Here

For every problem:

1. I start with **understanding and restating the problem**
2. I identify possible **algorithmic patterns** (e.g., two pointers, sliding window)
3. I reason through **design decisions and alternatives**
4. I intentionally make and analyze mistakes
5. I incrementally build the solution
6. I finalize with clean, accepted code
7. I document everything in a structured `.md` file

AI is used as a **coach and reviewer**, not as a shortcut.

## 🤖 How AI Is Used (Important)

AI is used to:
- Ask guiding questions
- Challenge incorrect assumptions
- Explain *why* certain approaches fail
- Reinforce reusable patterns
- Help structure learning documentation

AI is **not** used to:
- Dump final solutions upfront
- Skip reasoning
- Hide edge cases
- Replace understanding with memorization

Every line of code in this repo is written with full understanding.

## 📌 What Makes This Repo Different

- ✅ Focus on **thinking patterns**, not just answers
- ✅ Explicit documentation of mistakes and corrections
- ✅ Interview-friendly explanations
- ✅ Clear separation between logic and platform-specific details
- ✅ Honest representation of AI-assisted learning

---

## 🚀 Who This Repo Is For

- Anyone preparing for coding interviews
- Developers who want to improve problem-solving fundamentals
- Learners who want to use AI **responsibly**
- Reviewers who care about *process*, not just output

---

## 🔁 Reusable Mental Templates

Throughout the problems, I actively build and reuse templates such as:
- Two-pointer technique
- Loop condition reasoning (`and` vs `or`)
- Guarded access patterns
- Edge-case driven thinking

These templates are explicitly documented to support long-term retention.

## 📝 Final Note

This repository reflects **how I learn**, not just *what I solve*.

If you’re reviewing this repo (as a recruiter, interviewer, or fellow learner),  
feel free to focus as much on the **learning guides** as on the code itself.

Happy problem solving 🚀
